To be honest, optimising a Webpack bundle is probably one of the most annoying things I have to do as a Software Engineer.

Some resources to help you with it:

- [Blog post with multiple tools](https://medium.com/@joeclever/three-simple-ways-to-inspect-a-webpack-bundle-7f6a8fe7195d)
- [Blog post on how to reduce NextJS bundle](https://medium.com/ne-digital/how-to-reduce-next-js-bundle-size-68f7ac70c375)

## Tools

- [webpack-module-analyser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer)
- To understand why something is being bundled: [`whybundled` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whybundled). This requires generating Webpack stats with `[webpack-stats-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-stats-plugin)`.
- To debug production deployments: `npx bundle-wizard [https://example.com](https://inpractise.com)`
- Chrome DevTools Coverage: useful to know how bad your code coverage usage is.

Good luck with this not-so-nice-but-quite-important task!
