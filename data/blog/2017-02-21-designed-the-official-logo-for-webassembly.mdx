[Official repository for the WebAssembly Logo carlosbaraza/web-assembly-logo](https://github.com/carlosbaraza/web-assembly-logo)

[Some time ago](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/980#issuecomment-278086797) I submitted [my proposal (link to the official repository)](https://github.com/carlosbaraza/web-assembly-logo) for the [WebAssembly logo contest](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/980#issuecomment-278086797).

Today, I can say that it is the most voted logo with 1496 votes, and therefore it has become the official WebAssembly logo.

I am still impressed that 1496 technical people around the world voted for my design. Thank you to everyone who voted for it!

Thanks to everyone who voted for the logo, I could add my two cents to the great [Web Assembly project](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec).
