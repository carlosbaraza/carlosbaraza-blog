## Concepts

- Entity - Table name (e.g. user, article)
- Attribute / Field / Column
- Relation: relation between entities
  - 1:1 - One to one
  - 1:N - One to many
  - M:N - Many to many
- Tuple / Row / Record / Entry
- Table / File: Collection of tuples or rows and attribute names
- Database design: Process of designing data tables to guarantee data integrity
- Schema: structure of the database
- Keys: Used to guarantee uniqueness. Usually IDs.
- SQL: Structured Query Language
  - DDL: Data definition language. Part of SQL to define schema.
  - DML: Data management language. Part of SQL to query data.
- First formal form (1NF): [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form)
  - Atomic columns
    - Value should be **1 thing**. E.g. Full name should be splitted into First name and Last name
  - **Singular columns**
    - E.g. "favourite movies" would not work because you could store multiple items in the same field.
  - **No table column can have tables as values**. Most RDBMS enforce 1NF. No SQL systems allow an attribute to have relations and subvalues.
- Parent / Child:
  - In a relationship, there is always a parent and a child
  - Parent: Has Primary Key (PK)
  - Child: Has Foreign Key (FK)
- Intermediary table / Juntion table:
  - For implementing M:N relationships
- Binary relatioships:
  - Usually, relationships are between two entities.
  - It could be between more than two entities
- Index:
  - A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structure. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index)
- Look up table
  - Instead of repeating a membership like gold, silver, etc. Have a second table and reference it. Kind of Enum tables.
  - user:
    - | membership_id |
  - membership:
    - | id | membership |

## Keys

- Superkey: Any number of columns that create a unique key combining the values
  - There are many combinations of columns that create a unique key, so there are many superkeys.
- Candidate key: Superkey with the least number of columns
  - Could have many candidate keys: email, username, ID.
- Primary key:
  - Unique
  - Never changing
  - Never null
- Alternate key
  - Unique, never changing, never null.
  - Other candidate keys that are not the primary
- Surrogate key: Key that is created to guarantee uniqueness, oposed to natural keys. E.g. user_id.
  - Could be autoincrement or UUID
  - Surrogate are not usually given to the user. Because if you share the ID, it starts to gain meaning and become a natural key.
- Natural key: Key that occurs naturally in data. E.g. username could be a natural key.
- Surrogate key vs Natural key:
  - Usually easier to use surrogate keys than natural keys
    - Don't need to worry about data changing, because they will be unique
  - Be consistent and always use surrogate or natural keys
- Foreign key:
  - Reference to a primary key from a different table
  - NOT NULL: to require and ensure there is a relationship
  - Constraints
  - Foreign key constraints ^986268
    - ON UPDATE (if the foreign key in the parent changes)
      - CASCADE: Update the foreign key to reflect the change
      - RESTRICT (NO ACTION): Restrict the change in the parent table
      - SET NULL: Set NULL in the foreign key column
    - ON DELETE (if row with primary key referenced in foreign key is deleted)
      - CASCADE: Delete the row with the foreign key
      - RESTRICT (NO ACTION): Restrict the change in the parent table
      - SET NULL: Set NULL in the foreign key column
    - RESTRICT vs NO ACTION: In Postgres, the difference between RESTRICT and NO ACTION only arises when you define a constraint as `DEFERRABLE` with an `INITIALLY DEFERRED` or `INITIALLY IMMEDIATE` mode. [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-set-constraints.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-set-constraints.html)
- Simple key: One column
- Composite key: Multiple columns
- Compound key: Same as composite keys. Normally used interchangably, but better to stick to Composite key. Compound keys usually have all of the attributes being keys to other entities (e.g. many-to-many relationships). [https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/3134/in-sql-is-it-composite-or-compound-keys](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/3134/in-sql-is-it-composite-or-compound-keys)

### Data integrity

- Entity integrity: Ensure uniqueness in every entity. Usually solved with an ID column.
- Relational integrity / Referencial integrity: Usually managed by RDBMS to ensure relations exist and are safe.
  - Foreign keys should have contraints \[\[#^986268\]\]
- Domain integrity: Data is valid and follows the expected type. Partly solved with types. Also adding validations would help.

## Naming convention

- All lowercase
  - E.g. user, instead of User
- Singular entity name
  - E.g. user, article
- Underscores to separate entity words
  - E.g. card_payment instead of CardPayment
- Name ID columns with the table name: E.g. "user" table has "user_id". This way, all the tables referencing user_id would have the same name for it, including the "user" table.

## Database Relationships

- One to one
- One to many
- Many to many

### One to one relationship (1:1)

Could be:

- **Attribute**
  - If only need one data point to define the entity.
  - E.g. username: text
- **Foreign key to another table**
  - If you have more than one attribute for the same entity
    - E.g. Card number, card name, card issue date, etc.
  - Add foreign key on parent table
    - | user | card_id |
    - | card |

### One to many relationship (1:N)

- Add foreign key to child table
  - | user |
  - | card | user_id |

### Many to many relationship (M:N)

- Create a Intermediary / Junction table:
  - | user |
  - | user_id | card_id |
  - | card |

## Entity relationship modeling

Standard for drawing schemas

- ER Model: [Entity-relationship model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model)
  - ERD: entity relationship diagram
- EER Model: \[Enhanced entity-relationship model\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_entity–relationship_model#:~:text=The enhanced entity–relationship (EER,in the design of databases.)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_entity%E2%80%93relationship_model#:~:text=The%20enhanced%20entity%E2%80%93relationship%20(EER,in%20the%20design%20of%20databases.)>)
- Cardinality:
  - Multiple lines represent Many
  - One vertical line represents 1
  - !\[\[eer-cardinality.png\]\]
- Modality:
  - A 0 represents that the foreign key can be null, so there could be rows that don't have a parent.
    - Read as 0 or 1.
  - A line represents 1. Read as 1 or 1 when two vertical lines are displayed. It means that the foreign key has a NOT NULL constraint.

## Normalization

- 1NF: First normal form
  - Making everything atomic
  - A relation is in first normal form if and only if no attribute domain have relations as elements.
  - Basically, if a field has multiple values, that should be split into two tables.
    - | user_id |
    - | email_id | email | user_id (fk) | (this allows for multiple emails)
- 2NF: Second normal form
  - Removing partial dependencies
  - A relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF.
  - There are no partial dependencies for the relationship.
  - E.g.
    - user: | user_id |
    - book_author: | book_id | user_id | book_summary (wrong because it depends on the book_id) |
    - book: | book_id | title |
- 3NF: Third normal form
  - Removing transitive dependencies
  - E.g. poor design:
    - | review_id | stars | stars_meaning |
    - Star meaning changes with stars, so depends on something that is not a key
  - E.g. better design:
    - | review_id | star_id |
    - | star_id | stars | stars_meaning |

## Indexes

- Clustered
  - Reorganizes the data
  - Can only have one
- Non clustered
  - Points to the data
  - E.g. end of the book index
  - Can have multiple
- Composite
  - Index on multiple columns

Pros:

- Faster queries

Cons:

- Storage and memory
- Need to update the index when changes on the data happen. Writes are slower.

## Joins

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join\_(SQL)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)>)
- INNER JOIN (default JOIN)
  - Default join between two tables
  - Only returns the rows that match the condition in both tables
- Outer joins
  - Include all columns that don't match one in the joined table, including null values.
  - When the joined column is a foreign key and NOT NULL, outer joins would return the same than inner joins.
  - Types:
    - Left outer join (default): Include all non-matching rows in the left table
    - Right outer join: Include all non-matching rows in the right table
    - Full outer join: Include non-matching rows from all tables
- Self join:

  - Join a table with itself
  - For example:
    - | user_id | name | referred_by |
    - Self join on the referred_by to find the user and the referral

  SELECT u1.name, u2.name AS "referred_by"
  FROM user AS u1
  INNER JOIN user AS u2
  ON u1.referred_by = u2.user_id
