These are some of my notes on this interesting book, with interesting ideas on how to create a flourishing innovation driven organisation.

- **Nurture innovation separating soldiers and research**
  - Nokia failed to develop the iPhone because it was refused by management
  - Big organisations become risk averse and employees have low stakes. They become soldiers and franchise operators.
  - Startup employees have high stakes and win big. Innovators and risk taking.
  - Radar was proposed to Navy multiple times before WWII, and they refused funding
- **Have a context structure with multiple stakeholders that could give the idea a shot**
  - Kepler discovery of solar system happened in China but there was a single studio in town, the empire rulers. In Europe there were many small states willing to give scientific revolution a try.
- **Leaders could think they are holy heroes and hold the keys to the research lab, not letting some ideas flourish**
  - Polaroid didnâ€™t research digital cameras
