[PassportJS](http://www.passportjs.org/) is a great and mature library that supports many authentication methods. Therefore, it makes sense to use it.

However, PassportJS is using good old classic REST. Now we are faced with the question: should we handle authentication using GraphQL or keep using PassportJS?

Authentication can be handled separately adding a middleware checking authentication before every resolver. This way we can focus our GraphQL effort on more meaningful things.
