Hello! I'm Carlos, and I have been writing Software since I was a kid. As a passionate Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience, I commit to bringing technical knowledge and success to every project and organisation I work with.

Currently, CTO at [inpractise.com](https://inpractise.com). Previously worked at Bloomberg, Expedia, DAZN and others.

**I love web development**. I use modern but stable technologies, and I keep my knowledge updated. Playing music is my way to relax.
