## What is the problem?

As a web engineer, I need a cheap semi-professional playground where I could deploy all my side-projects and scale them if I really need to (never).

I often found myself slowed down and overwhelmed by the dev ops I needed to perform just to start a new project. Creating a new project was usually bringing many negative unconscious thoughts, imagining all the dev ops steps I needed to complete just to get started: set up VPS, configure DNS, configure Nginx, reread how to configure Nginx, configure Let’s Encrypt, set up production environment, pay the new increased bill… The result was a cumbersome feeling of procrastination.

I needed a platform that allowed me to hack something quickly and deploy it in a kind of professional environment, so I could start showing it off to my friends/Hacker News/Twitter/Reddit/nameit immediately.

## Requirements:

- Cheap: less than $15/month for all my side projects.
- Extremely simple to deploy new project: No dev ops needed.
- No technology stack enforced. Usually Node.js backend + SPA in the frontend. However, I like trying new things, and therefore I want the freedom to use whatever random language or technology that caught my eye that day.
- TLS Encryption (free, of course).
- Domain names for each project.

## What I came up with:

## New project process

These are the needed steps to deploy a new project once you completed the initial configuration (below).

1.  Create a new container from your repository in GitHub or BitBucket
2.  Expose the port 80.
3.  Assign it the following environment variables to the container:

- LETSENCRYPT_HOST=newcoolproject.appy.land: Used to register the certificate. Usually the same than VIRTUAL_HOST.
- VIRTUAL_HOST=newcoolproject.appy.land: host to be used to access the app.
- LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=myemail@appy.land: Used to register the certificate. You will receive alerts and other useful information in this email.

That’s it. You are done. The certificate will be automatically generated and all the encrypted traffic will be redirected to the container.

---

If you don’t use a wildcard  *CNAME (\*.appy.land),* like I do. You just need to point a CNAME to the _nginx-proxy_ service endpoint.

## Initial configuration

Have you ever heard of Docker Cloud? Docker Cloud allows you to orchestrate containers from a simple UI.
