I am a stubborn to-be entrepreneur. I am always looking for potential ideas to build and try. This is a quick reflection over a side-hustle that unfortunately didn't succeed.

## Getting excited

One day, I went to buy some sushi at a Wasabi franchise. What was my surprise when they asked me to scan a QR code after paying to collect reward points. At that exact point I thought, QR and NFC are cool, and I should facilitate the access to these technologies lagging behind in the west.

## Pivot #1: Loyalty cards

It sounded like a great idea to have loyalty cards where a cafe/restaurant customer would scan a QR/NFC code and collect stamps to get discounts.

#### Time invested: Not that much.

#### ROI: £0

#### Customers: 0

#### Take aways:

- Built a product before actually having any customers. Only based on some existing competitors in the space and the franchise Wasabi using a similar product.
- It is CRITICAL to find customers as soon as possible. Motivation will quickly drop, specially if all your effort building something is not valued by anyone.
- Tried cold door selling the product once. I was scared because I never did sales, and it took real courage to enter a cafe and pitch my idea to a random waiter there. They pretty much kicked me out (with good manners). That was a terrible experience, but I learned that sales was important and difficult to master.
- **Validate soon. Sell more.**

## Pivot #2: Smart plant label

Given that I usually struggle with patience to stick to a non validated idea, I decided to explore something else that interested me.

I love plants, and I have tens of them at home (seriously, my house is like a jungle, greenery all over the place :)). I would like to build something that helped customers to keep their plants alive, giving them care details. A simple label that plant shops could put on the plant and assign to a specific species.

#### Time invested: A lot

#### ROI: £500

#### Customers: 2

#### Take aways:

- Invest less time on MVP.
- Better SaaS than physical products.
- Manufacturing in China is unreliable. They make a lot of mistakes and it is difficult to communicate unless you have a big budget.
- Sales is critical. I should invest 50% of time on sales, at least. This time around I did better than earlier and managed to sell something, but it was not good enough. This is a challenge for Engineers-Entrepreneurs.
- Sell before building anything to validate the idea early.

## WebSummit 2019

We applied to WebSummit 2019 in Lisbon (Portugal), and we got accepted to participate in it as an Alpha company (less than 500k investment). This is a great experience and we met a lot of interesting people, even some potential investors and partners.

## The motivation decline

After WebSummit, I found a new role at Bloomberg and I also started working at another startup (InPractise.com). This, along with the lack of potential customers and partners, meant that Wisertag was forgotten and parked to the side.

Eventually... I took the executive decision of throwing away all the plant label stock, which was taking valuable space in my small London apartment.

That was a sad moment, but also a liberation, and it proved that I'm ready to move on and face a new challenge.

## Pivot #3: Dead cat bounce, COVID-19 restaurant menus

After the COVID-19 pandemic started, I had too much time to think. I then decided to reuse the name and try selling a simple product to create restaurant menus with a QR code the restaurants could print. This time around, I wouldn't build it first.

#### Time invested: Not much.

#### ROI: £0

#### Customers: 0, but multiple prospects.

#### Take aways:

- Changed the landing page to accommodate the new idea (checkout image bellow).
- Built a TripAdvisor email scraper for restaurants and collected around 20k emails for restaurants.
- Sent email to 2k restaurants in Spain, and got a few prospects.
- I got the feeling that it was not resonating that much, and I decided to drop the project before wasting any more time.
- I am happy that I didn't spent much time on this, this time around. This was a quick way to validate the idea, before building anything.

## Lessons learned

- **Don't build before selling.** Only allowed to build a landing page to sell and pitch the idea.
- **Minimise time to validation**. Wasted effort should be minimised.
- **Get at least 10 actual customers interested in the product before building anything.**
- **Validate soon. Sell more.**
- Physical products are hard. Manufacturing adds an extra complexity layer to the build process.

Wisertag was a great experience for me. It was an attempt to build a business. This time I didn't succeed, but there will be other opportunities.
