Today I would like to share with the web/toile/red my last project, Quadruino. It is an open source drone dreamed by some friends living together during university timespan. It will serve for multiple control theory/automation/electronic experiments.

I will eventually post more information about the Quad itself and how it was built. In the meanwhile, enjoy this video I made for the public kick off of the project!

Do not hesitate to leave me a comment if you want more information about the drone, or if you would like me to help you with your project.

Keep flying forward,   
Carlos.
