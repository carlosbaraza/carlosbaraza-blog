Finding the right problem to solve is quite a difficult task for some people. I have build tens of projects in the past few years, and I have been reflecting a lot on the failures. There are some requirements to be met, that are critical to the kind of business I want to make:

- **Niche market**. But ideally with upscale potential to bigger markets.
- **Online SaaS business**. Physical products introduce another dimension of problems, limit the scaling potential and also restrict where you could live.
- **Painful problem**. If people are reaching out for solutions to their problem, it is more likely they'd buy the service.
- **Growing market**. If the market is shrinking, it will be difficult to build a business around it.
- **Market with money**. Cheap customers will cause troubles, cost a lot in customer service and will not make for a good margin profitable business.

  - It's better to serve an audience that is used to pay for services.
  - Consumers are usually less inclined to pay money for services or tools.
  - B2B has longer sale cycles, but they understand that receiving value is worth paying for.
