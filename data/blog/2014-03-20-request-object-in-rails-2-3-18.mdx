During the execution of an action in Rails we can access to all the parameter of the request via de request object. This object includes the following useful methods:

- **headers** — Returns a hash containing the headers associated with the request.
- **body** — Returns an StingIO with the body.
- **host** — The hostname used for this request.
- **domain** — The hostname without the first part (usually “www”).
- **format** — The content type requested by the client.
- **method** — The HTTP method used for the request.
- **get?, post?, put?, delete?, head?** — Returns true if the HTTP method is get/post/put/delete/head.
- **port** — The port number (integer) used for the request.
- **protocol** — The protocol used for the request.
- **query_string** — The query string part of the URL — everything after “?”.
- **remote_ip** — The IP address of the client.
- **url** — The entire URL used for the request.

I found pretty useful the headers method to get headers like this:

    request.headers['CONTENT_TYPE']

Also you can the raw body like follows:

    request.body.read
